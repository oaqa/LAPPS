			<h2>A Framework for Rapid Adaptation and Reuse</h2>
			<p>The need for robust language processing capabilities across academic disciplines, education, and industry is without question of vital importance to national security, infrastructure development, and the competitiveness of American business. However, at this time a robust, interoperable software infrastructure to support natural language processing (NLP) research and development does not exist. To fill this gap, this project establishes an large international collaborative effort involving key players from the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia to develop an open, web-based infrastructure through which massive and distributed language resources can be easily accessed, in whole or in part, and within which tailored language services can be efficiently composed, disseminated and consumed by researchers, developers, and students.</p>
			<p>This project builds on the foundation laid in the NSF-funded <a href="http://www.anc.org/SILT" target="_blank">SILT (Sustainable Interoperability for Language Technology)</a> project as well as the momentum toward a comprehensive network of web services and resources within the NLP community. To this end, the project has the following goals:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Design, develop and promote a service- oriented architecture for NLP development that defines atomic and composite web services for NLP, along with support for service discovery, testing and reuse;</li>
				<li>Construct a Language Application Grid (LAPPS Grid) based on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/servicegrid/" target="_blank">Service Grid Software</a> developed at NICT and Kyoto University in Japan;</li>
				<li>Provide an <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2011/February/feb11_watson.shtml">open advancement (OA) framework</a> for component- and application-based evaluation that enables rapid identification of frequent error categories within modules and documents which module(s) and error type(s) have the greatest impact on overall performance, thus contributing to more effective investment of resources in both research and application assembly;</li>
				<li>Actively promote adoption, use, and community involvement with the LAPPS Grid.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The LAPPS Grid will dramatically impact resource and software sustainability, manageability, usability and composability/interoperability, and substantially eliminate redundancy of effort now common the in field, by providing the base for sustained and distributed community development in the years to come. As such, it will provide an unparalleled platform to support a wide range of activities and disciplines in higher- and secondary-education, including the humanities as well as the natural and social sciences.</p>
